<p>Came across this funny ditty by <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boas/">Ralph P. Boas</a> in the June 1984 issue of <em>The College Mathematics Journal</em>. The complete citation is: Boas, R. P. (1984). Spelling lesson. <em>The College Mathematics Journal, 15</em>(3), 217.</p>
<p><strong>Spelling Lesson</strong> <br /></p>
<p>Weep for the mathematicians<br />
  Posterity acclaims:<br />
Although we know their theorems<br />
  We cannot spell their names.<br /></p>
<p>Forget the rules you thought you knew<br />
Henri Lebesgue has got no Q.<br /></p>
<p>Although it almost rhymes with Birkhoff,<br />
Two H’s grace the name of Kirchhoff.<br /></p>
<p>The Schwarz of inequality<br />
And lemma too, he has no T.<br /></p>
<p>The “distribution” Schwartz, you see<br />
Is French, and so he has a T.<br /></p>
<p>In Turing’s name—no German, he—<br />
An umlaut we should never see.<br /></p>
<p>Hermann Grassmann—please try to<br />
Spell both his names with 2 N’s, too.<br /></p>
<p>If you should ever have to quote<br />
A Harvard Peirce, be sure to note<br />
He has the E before the I;<br />
And so does Klein. Rules still apply<br />
To Wiener: I precedes the E;<br />
The same for Riemann, as you see.<br />
But Weierstrass, the lucky guy,<br />
Has it both ways, with EIE.<br /></p>
<p>Fejer, Turan, Cesaro, Frechet—<br />
Let’s make the accents go that way,<br /></p>
<p>And as for Radon-Nikodým,<br />
Restore the accent, that’s my dream.<br /></p>
<p>“Stokes’s theorem” is O.K.<br />
“Stokes’ theorem” is an awkward way.<br />
“Stoke’s theorem” seems to be a joke,<br />
Or did you think his name was “Stoke?”<br /></p>
<p>But there is one I leave to you,<br />
Whatever you may choose to do:<br />
Put letters in or leave them out,<br />
Garnish with accents round about,<br />
Finish the name with eff or off:<br />
There is no way to spell Чебышëв<br /></p>

The poem was accompanied by this lovely illustration. No image credit was given; perhaps it was also Boas.
