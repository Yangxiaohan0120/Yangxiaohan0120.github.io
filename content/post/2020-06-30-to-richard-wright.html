<p><em>Four Sheets to the Wind</em> <br />
<em>And a One Way Ticket to France</em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a child <br />
I bought a red scarf and women told me how beautiful it looked, <br />
wandering through the sous-sols as France wandered through me.</p>
<p>In the evenings <br />
I would watch the funny people make love the way Maupassant said, <br />
my youth allowed me the opportunity to hear all those strange <br />
verbs conjugated in erotic affirmations. I knew love at twelve.</p>
<p>When Salassie went before his peers and Dillinger goofed <br />
I read in two languages, not really caring which one belonged to me.</p>
<p>My mother lit a candle for King George, my father went broke, we died. <br />
When I felt blue the Champs understood, and when it was crowded <br />
the alley behind Harry’s New York Bar soothed my restless spirit.</p>
<p>I liked to watch the nonconformists gaze at the paintings <br />
along Gauguin’s bewildered paradise.</p>
<p>Braque once passed me in front of Café Misique. <br />
I used to watch those sneaky professors examine the populace. <br />
Americans never quite fitted in but they tried, so we smiled.</p>
<p>I guess the money was too much for my folks. <br />
Hitler was such a prig and a scare. We caught the long boat. <br />
I stayed.</p>
<p>Main Street was never the same. I read Gide and tried to <br />
translate Proust. Now nothing is real except French wine. <br />
For absurdity is reality, my loneliness unreal, my mind tired.</p>
<p>And I shall die an old Parisian.</p>
