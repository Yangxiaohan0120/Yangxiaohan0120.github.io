      <description>This last weekend I competed in KVSC’s annual Trivia Weekend. Usually this is a 50 consecutive hour contest, but for 2021, it was only 33 hours. The last few years I competed with the team Take Me Back to Hackensack and we finished 31st out of 58 teams. Here is a photo of our team for this year.
This year we had a small team; between 2 and 6 players, depending on the hour, with four of us that were the base.</description>

      <description>We are almost a year into this dumpster fire called Coronavirus, so I thought I would do a little updating about the TV shows I am watching to pass the time through this nightmare. In no particular order, other than how they come to mind, the “winners” are:
All-American: I am watching this on Netflix and am most of the way through Season 2 (although Season 3 is airing now).</description>

      <description>Came across this funny ditty by Ralph P. Boas in the June 1984 issue of The College Mathematics Journal. The complete citation is: Boas, R. P. (1984). Spelling lesson. The College Mathematics Journal, 15(3), 217.
Spelling Lesson Weep for the mathematicians
Posterity acclaims:
Although we know their theorems
We cannot spell their names.
Forget the rules you thought you knew
Henri Lebesgue has got no Q.
Although it almost rhymes with Birkhoff,</description>

      <description>In the great pandemic of 2020 many of us are working from home. Since 40+ students now see me in my home, I thought I would write a post about the room that they often see me in. So in that spirit, welcome to my home office.

      <title>Book Publishing in Academia</title>

      <description>In 2019, I read a book called Patience &amp;amp; Fortitude: A Roving Chronicle of Book People, Book Places, and Book Culture. Aside from being incredibly entertaining and interesting, there was a passage that struck a chord with me that related to academic publishing. In this passage, James Billington, Librarian of Congress from 1987–2015, was lamenting the degradation of the book through the “hyperspecialization and bureaucratization” found in the academic monograph.</description>

      <description>Our department has an annual Graduate Student Research Day (GSRD) in which students present their research for the rest of the department. Although there are five speakers, one from each program in the department, the majority of students participate in a poster session. This year my student Chelsey Legacy put together a poster to present some of the data we collected from a fall administration of the Statistics Teaching Inventory.</description>

      <description>I am spring cleaning my computer and have a couple PNG files of plots I made that I want to adios. So, I thought to myself, “self…why don’t you put these on a blog post before you trash them forever.” It sounded like a good idea at the time, so here they are.
This second plot is a sunburst plot I created for the data visualization course. If I remember right, this was created using my annual TV watching data from 2017 and made using RawGraphs.</description>

      <description>It is the time of the semester when it seems every graduate student wants to make progress on their milestones, and several oral prelim exams and thesis defenses get crammed into a 1–2 week period. In the spirit of what I call “Thesis Season”, here are some good reads to keep this all in perspective.
Luke Burns wrote an inspired piece for McSweeney’s entitled FAQ: The “Snake Fight” Portion of Your Thesis Defense.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years I have tried to be a better steward of Planet Earth. There are a few specific actions that I have committed to that have actually had an impact on my life on a day-to-day basis. I share them with you in case you want to try them as well.

      <description>The internet is filled with interesting reads. Some thought-provoking, some inspiring, some enlightening, some just plain fun. Over the past few months I came across two that I would like to share with you.
Article 1: How Margaret Dayhoff Brought Modern Computing to Biology The first, How Margaret Dayhoff Brought Modern Computing to Biology was published by The Smithsonian and provided a biological sketch of Margaret Dayoff’s early adoption of computation to catalog and analyze biological data, in her case proteins.</description>

      <description>In 2017, my wife and I were fed up with the cost of cable television and were considering “cutting the cord”. In addition to cable, we also had Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, so our hypothesis was that we probably didn’t need cable. Before making the decision to cut cable, I wanted some data to help ensure that I would not be eliminating many of the TV shows that I watched.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the Gender Gap in Fiction</title>

      <description>Loganberry Books, an independent bookstore in Cleveland, intitiated a social experiment for in March 2019 called Illustrating the Gender Gap in Fiction. This experiment, in honor of Women’s History Month, was decribed as, “a live performance art project where we will shelve the works by men in our LitArts room backwards”. What a cool idea, and very eye-opening.
 Shelves of backward books emphasize the gender imbalance in literature.   This would likely be worse if the experiment was carried out with mathematics, statistics, and computer science books.</description>

      <description>I was recently perusing a book from 1960, Minnesota Heritage: A Panoramic Narrative of the Historical Development of the North Star State and came across the following map showing the locations of the colleges and universities in the state at the time.
 Figure 1: Minnesota Colleges and Universities in 1960  
The text referring to the map made an inference about the accessibility to higher education,
 At a glance the map shows, these facilities for higher education are quite uneveny distributed.</description>

      <description>In the fall of 2008 (maybe 2007; my memory is fleeting) our department moved from Burton Hall to the, at the time, newly renovated Education Sciences Building. This building is beautiful from the outside; brick, overlooking the Mississippi River. The building was designed in such a way that (at least on my floor) there are two long parallel hallways with the faculty offices on the outside of these hallways (running the exterior wall of the building) and the interior filled with lab space (small offices) for research grants.</description>

      <title>Inbox Zero</title>

      <description>On Saturday August 25, 2018 at 8:08 PM I finally hit Inbox Zero!
I did it by immediately copying the snippets of email I wanted into Evernote notes (my notetaking system). I also attended to to-dos more immediately, or added them to a note of “To-Dos”.
I doubt I will stay at zero emails in my inbox, but I have been at fewer than 10 emails all summer. Hoping to keep things at this level as the semester gears up.</description>
